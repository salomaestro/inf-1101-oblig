                     CALL FOR PAPERS


       ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED 2007 Conference on Languages
     Compilers, and Tools for Embedded Systems (LCTES07)
             http://www.cs.purdue.edu/lctes07/

         Part of FCRC (colocated with PLDI, ISCA etc.)

           San Diego, California, June, 2007



CONFERENCE SCOPES
As the complexity of embedded system s increases, new
research challenges are encountered for achieving the
desired design goals, such as programmability, reliability
and security, size, energy and power, timing constraints,
and scalability. Furthermore, embedded systems are
increasingly used in networked (wired, wireless, as well as
mobile) environments which enable a variety of new applications.
LCTES 2007 solicits papers presenting original work on
programming languages, compilers and tools for embedded
systems, as well as novel embedded architectures. Research
papers (which propose innovative techniques) and experience
papers (which report experimentation with and lessons learned
from real-world systems and applications) are both welcome.
(For more details of topics, please see the on-line Call for
Papers.) In addition to its regular sessions, LCTES 2007
will feature special events such as an industrial panel,
keynotes, tutorials and demonstrations to bring out the
latest and more interesting aspects of embedded systems.
Examples include tools for multi-cores, emerging platforms
such as smart phones multi-player game machines and real-time
multi-media players.
